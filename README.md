Just a very Simple Blockchain using Hashes in python

Blockchain is a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.

In more general terms, it’s a public database where new data are stored in a container called a block and are added to an immutable chain (hence blockchain) with data added in the past. In the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, these data are groups of transactions. But, the data can be of any type, of course.

Blockchain technology has given rise to new, fully digital currencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin that aren’t issued or managed by a central authority. This brings new freedom to individuals who believe that today’s banking systems are a scam or subject to failure. Blockchain has also revolutionized distributed computing in the form of technologies like Ethereum, which has introduced interesting concepts like smart contracts.
